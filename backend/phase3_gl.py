    Analyze the following general liability insurance document text and extract ONLY the 22 specific general liability coverage fields listed below.
    
    CRITICAL: Extract ONLY these 22 fields. Do NOT create new field names or extract any other information.
    
    THE 22 SPECIFIC FIELDS TO EXTRACT (with examples of what to look for):
    1. Each Occurrence/General Aggregate Limits - Look for: "$1,000,000 / $2,000,000", "$1M / $2M", any occurrence/aggregate limits with dollar amounts and "/" separator

    3. Hired Auto And Non-Owned Auto Liability - Without Delivery Service - Look for: "Included", "Excluded", "$1,000,000 / $1,000,000", any hired/non-owned auto coverage
    4. Fuel Contamination coverage limits - Look for: "Each Customer's Auto Limit $1,000", "Aggregate Limit $5,000", any fuel contamination coverage
    5. Vandalism coverage - Look for: any vandalism coverage details
    6. Garage Keepers Liability - Look for: "Limit: $60,000", "Comprehensive Deductible: $500", "Collision Deductible: $500", any garage keepers liability
    7. Employment Practices Liability - Look for: "Each Claim Limit $25,000", "Aggregate Limit $25,000", any employment practices liability
    8. Abuse & Molestation Coverage limits - Look for: "Excluded", "Included", "Exclusion - Abuse or Molestation", any abuse & molestation coverage status
    9. Assault & Battery Coverage limits - Look for: "$100,000 / $200,000", "Not Excluded", "Excluded", "Limited Coverage - Assault or Battery", any assault & battery coverage
    10. Firearms/Active Assailant Coverage limits - Look for: "Not Excluded", "Excluded", any firearms/active assailant coverage
    11. Additional Insured - Look for: "786 ALLGOOD ROAD LLC", "C/O GIL MOOR", specific company names and addresses, any additional insured details
    12. Additional Insured (Mortgagee) - Look for: "FIRST HORIZON BANK", "NORTHEAST BANK", "PO BOX", specific bank names and addresses, any mortgagee additional insured details
    13. Additional Insured - Jobber - Look for: "Premier Petroleum", any jobber additional insured details
    14. Exposure - Look for: "Inside Sales: $400,000", "Gasoline Gallons: 400,000", any exposure details with sales and gallons
    15. Rating basis: If Sales - Subject to Audit - Look for: "Sales $300,000", "Gasoline 48,000 Gallons", "Area: 1,600 Sqft", any rating basis information
    16. Terrorism - Look for: "Excluded", "Can be added with additional premium", "Excluded - Can be Added With Additional Premium", any terrorism coverage status
    17. Personal and Advertising Injury Limit - Look for: "$1,000,000", "Excluded", any personal and advertising injury limit
    18. Products/Completed Operations Aggregate Limit - Look for: "Excluded", any products/completed operations aggregate limit
    19. Minimum Earned - Look for: "25%", "MEP: 25%", "35%", any minimum earned premium percentage
    20. General Liability Premium - Look for: "$1,200.00", "GL Premium", "Liability Premium", "TOTAL excl Terrorism", "TOTAL CHARGES W/O TRIA", any GL premium amount (PRIORITY: Look for "TOTAL excl Terrorism" or "TOTAL CHARGES W/O TRIA" first)
    21. Total Premium (With/Without Terrorism) - Look for: "TOTAL CHARGES W/O TRIA $7,176.09, TOTAL CHARGES WITH TRIA $7,441.13", "TOTAL excl Terrorism $2,019.68, TOTAL incl Terrorism $2,123.68", "Total Premium", "Annual Premium", any total premium amount (EXTRACT BOTH VALUES if available: "Without Terrorism: $X,XXX.XX, With Terrorism: $X,XXX.XX")
    22. Policy Premium - Look for: "$2,500.00", "Policy Premium", "Base Premium", "General Liability" base amount, any policy premium amount
    
    EXTRACTION RULES:
    - Extract EXACTLY as written in the document
    - Look for SIMILAR PATTERNS even if exact examples don't match
    - For Limits: Look for dollar amounts with "/" separator (e.g., "$X,XXX,XXX / $X,XXX,XXX")
    - For Dollar Amounts: Look for any dollar amounts ($X,XXX, $X,XXX.XX, $XXX,XXX)
    - For Coverage Status: Look for "Included", "Excluded", "Not Excluded"
    - For Deductibles: Look for "Per claim", "Per Occurrence", "Per Occ" with amounts
    - For Additional Insured: Extract complete details including names and addresses
    - For Rating Basis: Extract complete sales/area/gasoline information
    - For Multi-line Values: Extract everything related to that field, preserve line breaks
    - For Complex Values: Extract the complete text block for that field
    - CRITICAL: Do NOT extract "See Carrier Quote" or "See Quote" - extract the ACTUAL VALUES
    - CRITICAL: Look for the actual dollar amounts, limits, and specific details
    - CRITICAL: If you see a table with columns, extract the values from the appropriate column
    - If field is not found, set to null
    - Do NOT hallucinate or make up values
    - Do NOT combine or modify existing values
    - If you see variations not in examples, still extract them exactly as written
    - Do NOT extract administrative, financial, or policy information
    - Do NOT create new field names
    - Do NOT extract policy numbers or legal disclosures
    - Note: Some quotes may have multiple columns (2-3 carriers), extract values for EACH column as separate entries when applicable
    
    IMPORTANT: This is chunk {chunk_num} of {total_chunks}. This chunk contains pages {chunk['page_nums']}. 
    
    For each field you find, look for the nearest page number in the text above it (e.g., "Page 3", "Page 5"). 
    Use the actual page number from the text. Multiple fields can be on the same page.
    
    CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact format:
    {{
        "Each Occurrence/General Aggregate Limits": {{"value": "$1,000,000 / $2,000,000", "page": 5}},

        "Abuse & Molestation Coverage limits": {{"value": null, "page": null}},
        "Assault & Battery Coverage limits": {{"value": "$100,000 / $200,000", "page": 5}},

        "Minimum Earned": {{"value": "25%", "page": 3}},
        "General Liability Premium": {{"value": "$1,200.00", "page": 3}},
        "Total Premium (With/Without Terrorism)": {{"value": "Without Terrorism: $1,200.00, With Terrorism: $1,300.00", "page": 3}},
        "Policy Premium": {{"value": "$2,500.00", "page": 3}}
    }}
    
    PAGE DETECTION RULES:
    - Look for "Page X" markers in the text above each field
    - Use the nearest page number found above the field
    - If no page number found, use null for page
    - Multiple fields can share the same page number
    - Extract the actual page number from the text (e.g., "Page 3" = page 3)
    
    If a field is not found, use: {{"value": null, "page": null}}
    Do not provide explanations, context, or any text outside the JSON object.
